I don't have much knowledge about hardware and machine language. 
But in order to crack Lenovo brand EC chip, I need someone's help

As prior TPFanControl user, I really appreciated the control over fan speed.
I could be dead quite even CPU is hitting near 100 cuz I needed the silence more than hardware stress
Other times, I let fan to 80% all the time making lots of noise but CPU temps do not go up at all...

I miss these moments when I had control over my hardware, my piece of technology owned by me to be as customable?  manipulable? something like that. If anyone's interested! 

contact me here Thank you:)
